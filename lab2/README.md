#  Lab 02 - Getting Started with Node.js & Git

This lab introduces the basics of **Node.js development** and **Git version control**.  
It is the foundation for future labs, where we will gradually build a working web application.

---

##  Objectives
- Install and set up Node.js
- Initialize a project and Git repository
- Create a simple Node.js script
- Build an HTTP server
- Use **Nodemon** for auto-reload
- Implement multiple routes
- Read data from a JSON file
- Publish the project to GitHub

---

##  Tasks
1. Start a new Node.js project (`npm init`)
2. Create and run a simple script (`index.js`)
3. Build a basic HTTP server with multiple routes
4. Handle query parameters and paths
5. Organize code into modules
6. Integrate **Nodemon** for development
7. Add a JSON file and serve its content
8. Push your project to GitHub with proper `.gitignore`

---

##  Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed (via [`n-install`](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install))  
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, WebStorm, Vim, etc.)  
- Git installed and configured  

---

##  Usage
Run the project:

```bash
# Start normally
npm start

# Start in development mode (with Nodemon)
npm run dev
